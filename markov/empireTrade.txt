I swear to Christ, we have officially dropped potions, especially drink potions as our official currency now and we still fucking trade in potions. Fuck me. Also, this is a really cheap trade run for expensive goods, a reflection of the booming UTC economy and what not, backed by the Common Market.

Prices have never before been so cheap. Also, experience from this trade run shows what people still fucking want. Fucking piece of shit... Nobody wants 3 stacks of bread, even if you sell it for 1 button for 3 stacks.

Information

This trade run was a scouting trade run, designed to find out the best times people get on MineZ oh and questioning others on the streets with surveys. Earlier before a daylight savings miscoordination mishap happened. Oh well. BUT ONEZEDARMY DOESN'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THAT, DOESN'T HE.

A trade run with a scout. Haven't had those in a long while. And this is also the first trade run where we will officially abandon potions as a currency denominator and instead use buttons.

A Trade Run of nothing but full combat gears because Irishkaiser was off being head chef. Actually sold nothing. At least they didn't decide to go PvPing after this and did more productive things in life.

An Idea, Mr.Creedy

A highly profitable trade run that has left me with an imprint. Also, like a road trip Irishkaiser began pestering OneZedArmy about the birthday of Asturias, to which he just kept quiet because he knows where that conversation is going.
