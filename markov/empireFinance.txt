Take out the stock ticker... And where's my actual certificates? What is this? I don't trust these new fangled computer doohickies.

A loss of over 40,000+ PHP was sustained after the Philippine government made the announcement that it has delayed announcing the third Telecommunications company from its supposed earlier. The Clan Bank backed the NOW Corporation, a Chinese-Filipino company over other candidates and things were going good until the announcement that it won't be until the 7th of November where they will finally announce, prompting people to back out as well until the date is closer.

You know what sucks, they've delayed announcing for like how many times.

Sick of playing the Telcos again for like the 3rd fucking time, the Clan Bank decided to stick to Mining, Logistics and smaller Communications companies to regain its losses.

Looks like Discord now, actually.

Did the same things I did when I was in Vietnam. Loved Halong Bay.

About a thousand dollars acquired in two days. I AM NOT FUCKING JOKING. RULES OF NATURE. AND THEY RUN WHEN THE SUN COMES UP..!

Looks like no one here has the balls to learn about finance.

The past couple of months have been terrible for the NOW Company but market's perception has so undervalued it that it is actually seen as an opportunity by the Clan Bank to find profit in it when people will realize(or REMEMBER) its actual worth as a solid and stable company. This method is taken from Warren Buffett.

The shares and stock prices for NOW are currently bottoming out. The trick would be to find the perfect bottom then we lie and wait.

The Universe amirite.
