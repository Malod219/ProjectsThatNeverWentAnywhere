Axes 
After whose stroke the wood rings, 
And the echoes! 
Echoes traveling 
Off from the center like horses.
 

The sap 
Wells like tears, like the 
Water striving 
To re-establish its mirror 
Over the rock 

That drops and turns, 
A white skull, 
Eaten by weedy greens.
 
Years later I 
Encounter them on the road--- 

Words dry and riderless, 
The indefatigable hoof-taps.
 
While 
From the bottom of the pool, fixed stars 
Govern a life.
