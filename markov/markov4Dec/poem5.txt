I can carry on with a vivid imagination, 
thinking about the future’s upcoming creation.
Technological advances and satellites,
travelling to the moon at the speed of light. 
What scientific and mind-blowing innovations.

Will we find life on other planets in space?
Will earth cease to exist without a trace?
We could find the world’s wonderful answers, 
or even find a cure on Mars for all kinds of cancer. 
Scientist’s conclusions with inventions in place.  

There are many themes of science fiction, 
many people are astounded with contradiction.
Government cover-ups regarding extraterrestrials,
trying to make sense of all things celestial.
Are there any boundaries without conviction?

Machines created to go forward in time, 
or travel into the past to prevent a crime. 
Stories about how society is always affected
in a phenomenon that’s scientifically projected. 
Influence of real or imagined science in prime. 

The human being species based on evolution, 
examination of natural events causing a revolution. 
Philosophy and societal shifts for the ontological, 
understanding how we know things of cosmological.
Will there ever be absolution in a confined solution?

There’s exploration through experimental conclusions,
revealing disbelief and causing chaotic allusion.
We find alternate points of view on topics we share,
giving us more clear perspectives of when and where. 
A community of big thinkers through possible delusion. 

Science fiction compels us to think with originality, 
using imagery and factual evidence through ingenuity.
