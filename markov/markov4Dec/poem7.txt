Chrome steeples
and asphalt highways.
Cities rife with technologies,
communications and capability.
Wracked by the electric disease.

Noise,
interfering signals.
Porcelain minds unfit for its
twisted entangling snare,
snaking through corroding sewers
and rusted tanglings of frayed
copper wires.

A neon wasteland,
hot and destitute,
inhabited by hedonism in
all its motley forms.
Genetically engineered foods,
Mind smearing chemicals,
Flashing screens bleeding minds,
breeding ignorance.
Desecrated psyches.
Massacre.

Built by humans,
For inhumans.
