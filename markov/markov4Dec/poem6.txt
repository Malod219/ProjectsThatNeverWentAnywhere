What hypothesis led us to ever believe in evolution? If humans evolved from a lower form, why did we stop? Is there a process that will propel us 
to our destiny, or have we reached it already? Is it really science, or does it better qualify as fiction? I'm trying very hard with this topic but seem to be moving in slow motion. There are things going on in our world that my father would not have imagined. He did not believe in evolution, but perhaps he could have imagined a driverless car. I think if he had a glimpse of artificial intelligence, he would still have preferred his own. Honestly, outside of my Biblical World View, I am one lost turkey. Anyway, I'm not a scientist and might be merely of average intelligence. I'm not a scientist, but I understand gravity, motion, space, and time.  If I jump off a building and fall straight down, that is not fiction but fact. If Superman(fiction) doesn't come to my rescue, I'll become 'one-with-the-pavement'(fact). After landing, if I'm not dead or experiencing broken body parts, believe me, that is pure fiction. If I step from a fast moving vehicle and keep in step as before, that's fiction, not fact. Not to worry, I'm not and niether should you try that stunt at home or anywhere else. What may be science fiction today, given process and time, might be true science tomorrow. If for no other reason,  science, as I see it, makes sense to me because it demands an origin, a process, and a destiny.   Sometimes, I understand fiction, especially when it is defined and presented as such.  But unlike science, fiction, as I see it,  has no absolutes and demands nothing.  Any way and on the contrary, my Biblical World View has both absolutes and clear cut demands, and it seems to be binding  me like glue.  Therefore, I'm sticking to it.
