I went off “English literature” at school,
The books were either grim or just plain boring.
Their worlds did not entice me, not at all -
They weren’t the worlds I longed to be exploring.

But there upon my father’s dusty shelf,
Were classics I could journey deep within,
Inside each musty page, transport myself -
Clarke and Aldiss, Asimov, Le Guin.

While Austen’s dullards simpered in their bonnets,
My heroes contemplated time and space.
A lightship through a wormhole? I’d be on it!
Escaping to some awe-inspiring place.

While Golding’s anti-heroes left me cheerless,
I thrilled to dive inside a robot’s soul,
Or teeter for a while, excited, fearless,
Upon the threshold of a huge black hole.

I still love science fiction with a passion,
Its wild potential fizzing in my head,
I’m sad to say, it’s always out of fashion -
But believe me, I could not be more “well read”!
