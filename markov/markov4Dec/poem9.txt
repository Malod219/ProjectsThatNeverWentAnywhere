UFO's, science fiction!
UFO's, how old would the occupants be?
The nearest known planet
outside our solar system is
twenty-five  trillion miles away,
or four point three light year old!
Travelling at twenty thousand mph,
it would take, 
one hundred and thirty-seven  thousand years,
to get there, that makes occupied ufo's,
science fiction!
Unless you know different!
