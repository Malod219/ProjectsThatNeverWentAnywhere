Some inventors and scientists, they have both said
That science fiction books put ideas in their head
A novel that was written by Arthur C Clarke
Gave Tim Berners Lee the necessary spark

The communicator in Star Trek that was fantasy
Martin Cooper of Motorola made it reality.
Beam me up Scotty, well that’s not here yet
Research is being done and they’ll crack it, you bet.

The news pads from the movie 2001
Now everyone has a tablet for online fun
Remember talking HAL, I’m sure you all do
Computer giants researched it and made it come true.

The movie Dick Tracy where they talk on their wrist
Now the smart watch is another to add to that list
Men dressed as robots in old movies you see
Now robots build cars, no longer fantasy.

Artificial intelligence now it can change your life
Any shape any colour, you can have one as your wife
But research and tech gadgets, are we moving too fast?
Mankind might become just a thing of the past.

Take for example a factory with two hundred men
Now all you need is a robot and a workforce of ten
But it’s not something new, just look at history
Job loss came with the intro of the Spinning Jenny.

Ray guns and flying saucers at area 51
They try to tell you that nothings going on
No need to panic it’s a research facility
Whilst making space age weapons for the military.

And films have inspired the creation of drones
Controlled very easily from an app on your phones
X-Ray drones are the ones that bother me
Wear a swimsuit in the shower because they will see

Robots that can think will outwit us one day
We’ll just be a nuisance and be put out of the way
Science fiction for many is just fantasy
But it inspires the great minds in creativity.
