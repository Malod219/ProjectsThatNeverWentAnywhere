Cyberpunk melodies from a broken shell.
Fishing a crooked coin from the wishing well.
Slanted rooftops slash and burn.
How the trapezoid takes its turn.

Scaling heights beyond the skies.
Some are dark most are lies.
Miscalculation to the Nth degree.
All we really want will never be free.

Reality melds with fiction.
When it suffers from inproper diction.
The glass stained with blood and light.
Is it wrong because it's right?

We categorise our lack of society
With a gross abundance of impiety.
Never ill always well.
Cyberpunk melodies from a broken shell.
