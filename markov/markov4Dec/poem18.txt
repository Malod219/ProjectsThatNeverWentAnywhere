Quickly and thoroughly as I possibly could
I scanned the pages in front of me.
The air, from the outset,
had been thick with dread, 
in this place it often was.
So intimate and close a witness was I
that I couldn't help but wonder
if I may be incidentally decapitated
while she was pointedly decapitated.
I might or might not have wondered
if we'd all be incidentally deafened
while she was pointedly deafened.
Strands of hair, torn from her head,
waited a moment for still
before settling, alarmed and trembling,
on her shoulders, 
and some on the floor.
I was so intimate and close a witness,
separated by no more
than half a tenuous yard,
and a hatred took root that day.
Quickly as I could, 
it may well have been too quickly, 
and thoroughly as I could,
which was not very thoroughly at all,
I scanned the pages in front of me
and wondered if I might be next.
