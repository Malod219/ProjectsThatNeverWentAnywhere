He doted on phishing, that viral, newfangled
invasion, though most of his handshakes got tangled.
He fumbled his Trojans, cunningly dangled
in front of my mouse so that I would be wangled
to click on the bait. My nerve ends were jangled.

I needed a password with which to unlock
those few paltry bytes. They were all poppycock.

but as for as this notional marriage, we’re through.” 
   
I wouldn’t have minded so much, I suppose,
but he gave me an Apple instead of a rose.

Are you ready to guess who he is? Knock, Knock.
Who’s there? Sad to say, my ex-husband is Who,
the cyberpunk man I unwittingly chose.
Instead of a lover, I married a geek.
