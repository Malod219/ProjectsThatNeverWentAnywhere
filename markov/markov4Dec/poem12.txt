Illuminatus
I don't know how a prisoner fits in a cell
how the matrix of justice gives energy
to the inner thoughts using mitochondria
the dentist never seems to smile
the chemist does not like fire wax
and politician does like logic
like the mathematician
I don't know how many planes a pilot flies
over the Atlantic 
aligned to the meridian
to the upper half of the hemisphere
at the top..a nipple
it was the hand of the child
and suckling of love
So we meet the lawyer
perusing the journal of a psychiatrist
who argues the existence of psychic energy
yet it seems the mist misses spirituality
and the ghostly scenes are unjust to conformity
so help him God
he has already lost the case
Here I am a feeble poet
playing with mind of logistic
creating planes and vertices
graphs of time in the fourth dimension
I fell in love yesterday but I feel it now
its time against matters
what matters against reality
as I write creativity rules logic
So here I am
applying ohms law on the smartphone
as long as electrons have kinetic energy
concentrated to diffuse for potential difference
it will light
this love that diffuses from this heart
if you re creative..create an electromagnetic spectrum
illuminate love
magnetise the unlike poles
choose the path of least resistance like electricity
and shine the sky
for NASA to study
for you re a universe
science dreams as fiction
