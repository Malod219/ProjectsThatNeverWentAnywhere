# ProjectsThatNeverWentAnywhere
A bunch of projects that never went anywhere

# Cicada3301
A book written by the Cicada3301 people. Still not fully translated if I recall correctly. Very intriguing, worth a look.
# DiscordGame
A Discord replica of DEFCON except it doesn't work and I lost inspiration because DEFCON is better than it in everyway. Was gonna play like a board game, similiar to diplomacy.
# GleamIoBotting 
Working off of a peculiar Gmail trick(whoever+number@gmail.com) to 'spam entries'. Got bored, and had to pass a captcha so no thank you.
# LotsOfTexFilter 
For when you have to filter for a word or character in a lot of text files in a directory.
# RedditUserCommentHistoryDump 
Dumps the user's reddit comment history. Useful for social engineering or mass surveilance I guess.
# TwitterRipper 
Same use case as RedditUserCommentHistoryDump. Useful I guess.
# WalkPi 
A raspberry pi project to make a working walkman-style raspberry pi device. Lost motivation.
# chunkyLogoScrap 
A project to scrape SVG/JPEG files from webpages. Never went anywhere. Sadly most websites don't use SVGs due to how they are handled different from browser to browser(Slightly but significantly enough).
# LocationLootViewer
Loot viewer for a dead minecraft multiplayer server called MineZ. Useless and terrible code.
